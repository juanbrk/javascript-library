# javascript-library
This project is intended to help me improve my Front End Javascript skills. 

In this project I've learned:

- Interacting with DOM elements
- Using localStorage
- Taking user input
- Rendering and re-rendering DOM when new input is received

# LIVE DEMO

The site is alive here: https://juanbrk.github.io/javascript-library/

If you open it and don't see any book being rendered, reload the page and you'll see'em. I don't know why this is happening and will be taking a look at it pretty soon. 

Have fun and enjoy my site!

Built with <3 from Argentina.
